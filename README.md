# Mandaue Foam Inventory Management System

A streamlined inventory management and customer inquiry application for Mandaue Foam store personnel.

## Overview

This application replaces the current multi-step, error-prone process of checking product availability and tracking customer inquiries. Instead of manually transferring data between the Mandaue Foam website and Google Sheets, store personnel can now perform all inventory-related tasks in a single platform.

## Problem Statement

The process of item enquiry is long — a customer service representatives check the Mandaue Foam website for the item SKU and then encode it into a heavily formulated Google Sheet for availability enquiry and demand tracking.

While functional, this method is prone to human error, requires regular updates to the Google Sheet, and lacks efficiency.

## Key Features

### Unified Search Interface
- Search for products directly within the application
- No need to switch between website and Google Sheets
- Record customer inquiries in the same platform

### Direct SAP Database Integration
- Real-time connection to your SAP Database
- Updates in SAP immediately reflect in the app
- Eliminates manual data transfer between systems

### Flexible Search Options
- Search by Item Name
- Search by Item Variant
- Search by SKU (with QR Scan capability)

### Comprehensive Inquiry Filtering
Filter customer inquiries by:
- Availability status
- User (person who encoded the inquiry)
- Inquiry date
- Branch location
- Specific item
